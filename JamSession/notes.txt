- I need to think about error handling (how do apps even do that?)
    - what if instrumentTwo is nil but the proficiency isn't?
        - This might be easy to think about if I understood optionals better
        
- Should people have ratings? (yes, but do it later)

- Browse vs Tinder matching?

- Slider gradients if you want: https://iosexample.com/swiftui-sliders-with-custom-styles-for-ios/

- Learn to size buttons with screen for ProfileForm

- It'd be cool if you could form groups and group chats in the app, but for now I should probably stick with single matches
    - One at a time looking vs group searching would also be dope
    
- I need to add drag functionality for photos sometime

- I would like the sign up button text to remove the button background

- DELETING PHOTOS ONLY WORKS CORRECTLY SOMETIMES
    - I did get a bit further understanding why. Check the index of the photo last deleted. It's incorrect sometimes
    - Also I need to make sure you have to have at least ONE. Good place to learn popups(?)
    
- Shadows for text boxes or no?

- I need to learn how to store passwords and all that stuff

- Change the popup color

- X and back buttons for Onboarding

- Should the password font size be smaller (what's a good length)?
    - I also need to make a "change password" place in settings
    - I should also give a crap about how good your password is eventually (require x amount of numbers, etc)
    
- Remove white space for name entries

- I'd like to change the action sheet button colors
